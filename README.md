# Fei_Zibeng_Reinforcelearning
This GitHub repository is created for practice to get started with reinforcement learning, including code implementations of various algorithms and insights from reading related papers.
## Study notes and implement the code for various classic reinforcement learning algorithms.
### Before everything，I studied [MathFoundationRL taught by Zhao Shiyu](https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning) for about thirty hours, gaining a contextual understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms.
#### It includes：
- Basic Concepts
- Bellman Equation
- Bellman Optimality Equation
- Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
- Monte Carlo Learning
- Stochastic Approximation and SGD
- Temporal-Difference Learning
- Value Function Approximation
- Policy Gradient Methods
### [Gymnasium_tutorial](https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/training_agents/reinforce_invpend_gym_v26/)
- A2C（with better advantage GAE，and offpolicy more like PPO）
By using it, I can train a quadruped robot dog (although it looks quite clumsy).
- REINFORCE(An early policy gradient algorithm, the principle of which is to maximize the Monte Carlo mean)
By using it ,I can trian a Inverted Pendulum.
