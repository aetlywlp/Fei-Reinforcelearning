# Fei_Zibeng_Reinforcelearning
This GitHub repository is created for practice to get started with reinforcement learning, including code implementations of various algorithms and insights from reading related papers.
## code to algorithm
### Gymnasium_tutorial
- A2C（with better advantage GAE，and offpolicy more like PPO）
By using it, I can train a quadruped robot dog (although it looks quite clumsy).
- REINFORCE(An early policy gradient algorithm, the principle of which is to maximize the Monte Carlo mean)
By using it ,I can trian a Inverted Pendulum.
